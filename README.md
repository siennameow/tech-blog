## Description üìù 

Techship Blog provides a content management system (CMS) to run a blog site. Users can log in to publish a post on the site and leave comments on posts. Logged in users have the ability to edit or delete previous posts from their dashboard. Non-logged in users can freely view published posts, but need to sign up to publish posts or leave comments.

Techship Blog is a full stack web application built following the Model View Controller (MVC) design paradigm. It uses MySQL and Sequelize for model definition and interaction, handlebars.js as the HTML view templating engine, and express.js for the server. The site uses cookies and session data to restrict access to publishing posts and comments to logged in users.

The web application is hosted on Heroku. Link to deployed website: https://techship.herokuapp.com/

## Code Snippet üíª

API Routes
The PUT `/api/posts/:id` route update selected post(by `id`) data with new data

```JavaScript
router.put("/:id", withAuth, (req, res) => {
  Post.update(
    {
      title: req.body.title,
      content: req.body.content,
    },
    {
      where: {
        id: req.params.id,
      },
    }
  )
    .then((postData) => {
      if (!postData) {
        res.status(404).json({ message: "No post found with this id" });
        return;
      }
      res.json(postData);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.log(err);
      res.status(500).json(err);
    });
});
```

Model association

```JavaScript
//User has many post
User.hasMany(Post, {foreignKey: 'user_id'})
//post belong to user
Post.belongsTo(User, {foreignKey: 'user_id', onDelete: "cascade"})
//user has many comment
User.hasMany(Comment, { foreignKey: 'user_id', onDelete: "cascade"});
//comment belong to user
Comment.belongsTo(User, { foreignKey: 'user_id', onDelete: "cascade"});
//post has many comment
Post.hasMany(Comment, { foreignKey: 'post_id', onDelete: "cascade"})
//comment belong to post
Comment.belongsTo(Post, { foreignKey: 'post_id', onDelete: "cascade"});
```

Views/Handlebars
Dashboard handlebars render all the posts from this specific logged in user and use `dashboard-detail.handlebars` partials to build the template

```handlebars
{{#if posts.length}}
<section>
  <h2>Post History</h2>
    {{#each posts as |post|}}
      {{> dashboard-detail post}}
    {{/each}}

</section>
{{/if}}
```
